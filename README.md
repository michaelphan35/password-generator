# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that would generate a random password bassed
on accepted criteria of: password length and usage of numbers, letters, and symbols.

Javascript, HTML and CSS were the technologies used for this project because these two languages allowed for the website
to function in the exact same way even after changes were made to the HTML and CSS. A few things to note are: the index.html
and CSS were completed and provided to us students for this project and the javascript was partially provided to us.
Therefore, the only main focus of this project was to add to the javascript file in a way that when a user interacts with the website,
they would be able to generate a random password from their own desired criteria.

## How to Access the Project

*Start by pulling/cloning the files related to the project from the GitHub repository. A zip file for the project
can also be downloaded, but the files would need to be extracted afterwards.

*Open the index.html style.css and script.js file using a code editing software such as VS Code.
